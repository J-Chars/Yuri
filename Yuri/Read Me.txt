  = Q & A =


 Q : Why Yuri? 

 A : I believe Yuri is a simple enough SNK character to do, yet complicated enough to give me a challenge.
     Also, I'll be making Ryo in the near future to it's best I just have them both.


 Q : What's her playstyle like?

 A : Yuri plays mainly like her CvS2 appearance, yet has a few of her KOF moves and supers.


 Q : How do you play Yuri?

 A : Yuri does not have a good fireball game. Yet, her Saifa acts as a decent shield. Her options for moving in are aplenty,
     and she's mainly a rushdown/poker type character. Her entire move set is at it's strongest when close range, and when
     she does avoid all the fireballs, she is quite scary up close. Her normals have excellent frames, and her combo ability
     on the majority of her specials allow for a lot of creative combos. Use her demon flip frequently. Her dive kick is very
     good at closing the gap, and the demon slam she has is very good for catching opponents in air-to-air situations.
